# TIPM | Trade & Industrial Impact Propagation Model (v6.0-Macro)

**Strategic Decision Intelligence for the Decoupling Era.**

---

## 🏛️ Executive Abstract

In an era of rising geoeconomic fragmentation, the **Trade & Industrial Impact Propagation Model (TIPM)** serves as a mission-critical "Stress Test" environment for sovereign industrial policy. This platform is not a static database; it is a **Deterministic Causality Engine** designed to quantify the systemic shocks of trade intervention across global supply chains.

By leveraging **Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO)** logic, TIPM moves beyond gross trade stats to "Value Added" metrics, allowing policy architects to visualize the recursive ripple effects—upstream, downstream, and domestic—of a single tariff shock.

## 💎 Value Proposition: Solving the "Singapore Paradox"

Standard trade models often ignore the embedded value of third-party nations in bilateral flows. TIPM solves the **Singapore Paradox**: understanding why a superpower trade war hit small, resource-rich, or hi-tech intermediate nations with twice the volatility of the direct targets.

- **High-Fidelity Granularity**: 190+ Economies | 45+ Industrial Sectors.
- **Dynamic Baselines**: Anchored in real-time WTO Applied Tariffs and OECD TiVA 2024 datasets.
- **Narrative AI**: Automated generation of qualitative causal reasoning for executive briefings.

## ⚙️ Architectural Blueprints

### Core Simulation Pillars

1. **Direct Revenue Contraction**: Real-time modeling of export volume decay in targeted sectors.
2. **Upstream Contagion (Bullwhip)**: Recursive trace of value-added loss for intermediate resource providers.
3. **Domestic Inflationary Blowback**: Quantification of deadweight loss and consumer price spikes in the importing nation.
4. **Strategic Retaliation Matrix**: Predictive modeling of secondary policy responses.

### Technology Stack (Enterprise Grade)

- **Engine Layer**: Python 3.11 / FastAPI | High-performance deterministic simulation solver.
- **UI Logic Layer**: Next.js 14 / TypeScript | Interactive "Mission Control" visualization suite.
- **Persistence Layer**: PostgreSQL + Prisma | Unified Trade Matrix and Economy Profiles.
- **Orchestration**: Docker-Native architecture for frictionless deployment in private cloud/NAS environments.
